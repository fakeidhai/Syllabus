What Does Active Database Management System (ADBMS) Mean?
An active database management system (ADBMS) is an event-driven system in which schema or data changes generate events monitored by active rules.
Active database management systems are invoked by synchronous events
generated by user or application programs as well as external asynchronous data change events such as a change in sensor value or time.
